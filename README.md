# points-equipe-jeux

First project in Javascript and JQuery.

# What it does : 

- 2 buttons that add points to 2 different counters
- When one of them reaches 10, the buttons disappears, and an ending message is displayed.

# Is it compatible : 

- Desktop : YES
- Mobile : I guess it is, but still has work to be done on.

# Goals for this project :

- Add CSS...
- ...and animation/sounds overall.
- Add rounds.
- Add a visible reset button.
- Incorporate it in my other project, "pictionnary-wsf".
